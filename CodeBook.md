The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Files

The file used on the R script are the following:

features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels.
train/subject_train.txt / test/subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels.
Variables

The data used on this project contains

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 66-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables (mean and standard deviation for each one).
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
Output Data Set

The tidy data set is a set of variables group by each activity and each subject. 10299 instances are split into 180 groups (30 subjects and 6 activities) and 66 mean and standard deviation features are averaged for each group. The resulting data table has 180 rows and 69 columns: 33 Mean variables (Average) + 33 Standard deviation variables (Average) + 1 Subject Code + Activity Desciption + ActivityCode . The tidy data set’s first row is the header containing the names for each feature.
